# YelpCamp

This project was created through a tutorial as part of Colt Steele's Online Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. They site is a mock campsite review site.

The site includes a landing page, index page displaying all campsites available, show page for each individual campsite, and editable commenting.

The forum was the most complicated section to code, as it includes an authorisation system whereby the user has to be logged in to view questions, and edit and delete their own comments. Passport.js was used for this.

Technology this project uses:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Passport.js
- Bootstrap

Here are some examples of the pages that were created.
